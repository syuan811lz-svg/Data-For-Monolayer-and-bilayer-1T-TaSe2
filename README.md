 # Data-For-Monolayer-and-bilayer-1T-TaSe2
This compressed file consists of two parts, each corresponding to Figure 1 and Figure 2 of our paper titled "Monolayer and bilayer 1T-TaSe₂ in the David-star CDW phase: Insights from intra- and interlayer (quasi)bonding".
Figure 1: Crystal structures (POSCAR) and band structure information (PROCAR) of the distorted and undistorted 1T-TaSe₂ monolayers
Figure 2: Crystal structure information (POSCAR) of the four types of 1T-TaSe₂ bilayer stackings
